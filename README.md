## molecular dynamics
[one](/one), [two](/two) and [three](/three) are molecular dynamics simulations of the competition reaction

each folder includes an aligned trajectory and a bonds file for analysing the trajectory

## umbrella sampling

[four](/four), [five](/five) and [six](/six) are montecarlo simulations of the competition reaction at 30, 40 and 50Â°C
